# Hackout

“Loc Fest” or “ Local Festival ” - provides a platform with the idea of going #VocalForLocal and #Aatmnirbhar Bharat by promoting the local artisans, painters, potters and other small scale businesses.



So, here we have taken the initiative through our project "LOC FEST". A step to bring smiles to the face of beautiful people. We can solve some problems of the people through our project.

The problem Loc Fest Solves :
•	Providing widespread, reach to local artisans such as street hawkers and vendors beyond the confined bylanes of small markets.
•	Making their extraordinary handmade craft and skills known to people.
•	Providing a safer and cheaper alternative to the factory-made artificial festivity materials.
•	Providing access to people to reach out to these artisans and buy their products, in turn, nurturing support for them and going #Vocal For Local and #Aatmanirbhar Bharat

“ Loc Fest ” aims to solve all these problems by creating an E-commerce platform for users where it does not need to search physically for these artisans in the market lanes, and have access to a wide array of these products at the comfort of their homes. 
Our platform enlists a wide-ranging festive related goods such as diyas, murtis (idols), festive decoration, candles, etc that are handmade and are produced by these local level artisans. 
This is accomplished by:
•	Letting all these small-scale artisans to be registered with our network to be able to enlist and sell their product through our website/app
•	Providing the end-to-end delivery service just like E-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart, facilitating as a bridge between these small-scale sellers and the interested buyers.
•	Letting the Users support these artisans financially also by providing them tip-offs and customer reviews.

Not just Diwali, but our E-commerce platform remains operational all throughout the year, supporting these local artisans by providing them more opportunities to diversify their sales and reach, instead of just a few days of work during profit-making festive seasons.
